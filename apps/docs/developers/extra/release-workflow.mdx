This document explains how our automated release process works using Release Please.

## Overview

We use [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) to automate releases. When you push to `master`, Release Please automatically:

1. Parses commit messages for conventional commits
2. Creates/updates a Release PR with version bumps and changelog
3. Tags and creates a GitHub release when the Release PR is merged

## How It Works

### 1. Write Conventional Commits

Use these prefixes in your commit messages:

- `feat:` - New feature (minor version bump)
- `fix:` - Bug fix (patch version bump)
- `feat!:` or `fix!:` - Breaking change (major version bump)
- `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:` - No version bump

```bash Example Commits
feat: add user authentication
fix: resolve login button issue
feat!: change API response format
```

### 2. Push to Master

When commits with releasable changes (`feat`, `fix`, `deps`) are pushed to master, Release Please automatically creates or updates a Release PR.

### 3. Release PR Lifecycle

Release PRs have status labels:

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Pending" icon="clock" horizontal>
    `autorelease: pending` - PR is ready for review/merge
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tagged" icon="tag" horizontal>
    `autorelease: tagged` - PR merged, release tagged
  </Card>
  <Card title="Published" icon="check" horizontal>
    `autorelease: published` - GitHub release published
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 4. Merge Release PR

When you merge the Release PR, Release Please:

1. Updates `CHANGELOG.md` and version files
2. Creates a git tag with the new version
3. Creates a GitHub Release

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  - **Use squash-merge** for PRs to maintain clean commit history - **Write
  clear commit messages** that explain the change's impact - **Review Release
  PRs** before merging to ensure correct version bumps
</Tip>

## Manual Version Override

To release a specific version, add `Release-As: x.x.x` to your commit body:

```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: release 2.0.0" -m "Release-As: 2.0.0"
```

## Troubleshooting

### No Release PR Created?

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Releasable Commits">
    Ensure you have `feat:`, `fix:`, or `deps:` commits
  </Step>
  <Step title="Remove Stale Labels">
    Look for old PRs with `autorelease: pending` labels
  </Step>
  <Step title="Force Rerun">
    Add `release-please:force-run` label to trigger manually
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Fix Release Notes

Edit the merged PR body and add:

```
BEGIN_COMMIT_OVERRIDE
feat: corrected commit message for release notes
END_COMMIT_OVERRIDE
```

<Note>
  This allows you to correct commit messages that will appear in the release
  notes after the fact.
