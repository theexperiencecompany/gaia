# Meeting Prep Workflow

Walking into a meeting unprepared is a waste of everyone's time, yet preparation often gets squeezed out by back-to-back schedules and competing priorities. GAIA's meeting prep workflow ensures you arrive at every important meeting fully briefed, with relevant context at your fingertips and clear objectives in mind. Instead of scrambling through emails and documents in the five minutes before a call, you receive a comprehensive briefing that synthesizes everything you need to know—who's attending, what's been discussed previously, what decisions need to be made, and what outcomes you should drive toward.

The intelligence of this workflow lies in its ability to distinguish between meetings that require extensive preparation and those that don't. Your daily standup doesn't need a briefing document, but that client presentation absolutely does. GAIA analyzes each calendar event to determine its importance based on attendees, meeting title, and your historical patterns. For high-stakes meetings, it automatically triggers a comprehensive research and preparation process that would take you thirty minutes to do manually but happens automatically in the background.

## How the Workflow Operates

The meeting prep workflow monitors your calendar continuously, scanning for upcoming events that match your preparation criteria. When it identifies a meeting requiring prep work, it triggers twenty-four hours in advance—giving you time to review the briefing and add your own notes before the meeting. For particularly important meetings like board presentations or client pitches, you can configure earlier triggers like forty-eight or seventy-two hours to allow for more extensive preparation.

The workflow begins with attendee research, gathering information about everyone who will be in the meeting. For external attendees like clients or prospects, GAIA searches your email history to find previous conversations, checks your CRM for account information, and scans LinkedIn for recent updates about their company or role. For internal attendees, it reviews recent project updates, checks what they're currently working on, and identifies any pending items between you. This attendee intelligence helps you understand who's in the room, what their priorities are, and how to tailor your communication.

Next comes context gathering, where GAIA assembles all relevant information related to the meeting topic. If the meeting is titled "Q3 Budget Review," the workflow searches for budget documents, financial reports, previous budget discussions, and related email threads. It identifies the most recent version of key documents and includes links in your briefing. If the meeting is a project status update, GAIA pulls the latest project plan, recent task completions, current blockers, and upcoming milestones. This context aggregation ensures you have all relevant information in one place rather than scattered across multiple systems.

The workflow then performs conversation history analysis by reviewing previous meetings with the same attendees or on the same topic. If this is your monthly check-in with a client, GAIA summarizes what was discussed last month, what action items were assigned, and whether those items were completed. If this is a follow-up to a previous meeting, it highlights open questions and unresolved issues that need to be addressed. This historical context prevents you from rehashing old ground and helps you drive the conversation forward.

Action item tracking is another critical component. GAIA reviews your task list and email to identify any commitments you made that are relevant to this meeting. If you promised to send a proposal by this meeting, the workflow checks whether you've completed that task and flags it if you haven't. If the other attendees made commitments, GAIA tracks those as well and includes them in your briefing so you can follow up. This accountability tracking ensures meetings are productive rather than just status updates.

The workflow concludes by generating a structured briefing document that typically includes meeting objectives, attendee profiles with relevant context, key discussion topics with background information, open action items and their status, relevant documents and links, suggested talking points, and potential decisions that need to be made. This briefing is delivered to you through your preferred channel—as a notification with a link to the full document, as a message in Slack, or displayed prominently in GAIA when you open the app.

## Setting Up Your Meeting Prep Workflow

Creating this workflow starts with defining which meetings require preparation. Not every calendar event needs a briefing—your daily standup, casual coffee chats, and internal team syncs probably don't require extensive prep. Open the workflow builder and configure meeting selection criteria based on attendee count, external participants, meeting duration, and keywords in the title. A good starting configuration might be: prepare for any meeting with external attendees, any meeting longer than forty-five minutes with more than three people, or any meeting with keywords like "presentation," "review," "pitch," or "demo."

Connect the data sources that will feed your briefings. At minimum, connect your calendar and email. For comprehensive briefings, also connect your CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot), project management tools (Linear, Asana), document systems (Google Docs, Notion), and communication platforms (Slack). The more systems you connect, the more context GAIA can gather. Configure read permissions for these integrations so the workflow can access relevant information without requiring manual exports.

Customize your briefing template to match what information you find most valuable. Some users want extensive attendee research with recent LinkedIn activity and company news. Others prefer minimal attendee info and more focus on discussion topics and decisions. Configure sections like attendee profiles, conversation history, relevant documents, action item status, suggested agenda, and key talking points. You can also add custom sections specific to your role—sales professionals might want deal status and objection handling notes, while product managers might want feature requests and user feedback.

Set your preparation timing based on your work style and meeting types. The default twenty-four hour advance notice works well for most meetings, but you might want longer lead times for high-stakes events. Configure rules like "prepare forty-eight hours before client presentations," "prepare seventy-two hours before board meetings," and "prepare twelve hours before internal project reviews." You can also set minimum preparation times—don't trigger the workflow for meetings happening in less than four hours, since there's not enough time to meaningfully prepare.

Define your research depth based on meeting importance. For routine check-ins, a brief summary of recent conversations and pending action items might suffice. For critical meetings, you might want comprehensive research including competitor analysis, market trends, and detailed attendee backgrounds. Create tiered preparation levels—basic, standard, and comprehensive—and assign meetings to tiers based on their characteristics. This tiered approach ensures you're not over-preparing for routine meetings or under-preparing for important ones.

Configure your briefing delivery to ensure you actually review it before the meeting. Set up notifications that alert you when a briefing is ready, with reminders if you haven't opened it within twelve hours. Some users prefer briefings delivered first thing in the morning for afternoon meetings, while others want them the evening before. You can also set up calendar integration to automatically block fifteen minutes before important meetings for briefing review, ensuring you have dedicated time to prepare.

## Outcomes and Benefits

The meeting prep workflow transforms you from someone who's often caught off guard to someone who's consistently well-prepared and in control. Attendees notice the difference—you reference previous conversations accurately, you come with relevant questions prepared, and you drive meetings toward productive outcomes rather than just reacting to whatever gets discussed. This preparation builds your reputation as someone who's organized, thoughtful, and respectful of others' time.

The workflow saves significant time through automated research and context gathering. What would take you thirty minutes of manual work—searching through emails, finding documents, reviewing previous meeting notes, researching attendees—happens automatically in the background. You invest just five to ten minutes reviewing the briefing rather than thirty minutes compiling it. Over the course of a week with multiple important meetings, this time savings compounds into hours of recovered productivity.

Meeting effectiveness improves dramatically when you arrive prepared. Instead of spending the first fifteen minutes of a meeting getting everyone on the same page about context and history, you can jump directly into substantive discussion. You drive toward decisions rather than just information sharing. You follow up on commitments rather than letting them slip. Meetings become shorter and more productive because preparation eliminates wasted time.

The workflow also reduces meeting anxiety by replacing uncertainty with confidence. When you know you have a comprehensive briefing waiting for you, you don't stress about whether you're forgetting something important. You can focus on your current work knowing that GAIA will ensure you're prepared when the time comes. This mental peace is particularly valuable for people who struggle with meeting-related stress or imposter syndrome.

The attendee research component helps you build stronger relationships by demonstrating that you've done your homework. When you reference a client's recent company announcement or congratulate a colleague on a project milestone, it shows you're paying attention and care about them beyond just the immediate meeting agenda. These small touches of personalization build rapport and trust over time.

The action item tracking ensures accountability and follow-through. When your briefing shows that you committed to sending a proposal but haven't done it yet, you have time to complete it before the meeting. When it shows that others made commitments they haven't fulfilled, you can follow up diplomatically. This accountability prevents meetings from becoming repetitive status updates where the same items get discussed week after week without progress.

Over time, the workflow helps you become a better meeting participant by teaching you what good preparation looks like. As you review briefings and see what information is most valuable, you develop better instincts for what to prepare manually when needed. The structured briefing format also provides a template you can use for meetings that don't trigger automatic preparation.

## Advanced Customizations

Power users can enhance the meeting prep workflow with sophisticated intelligence and automation. Add sentiment analysis to email threads related to the meeting, flagging if recent conversations have been tense or contentious so you can prepare for difficult discussions. Integrate with your company's knowledge base to automatically include relevant internal documentation, policies, or best practices. Connect to industry news sources to include recent developments relevant to the meeting topic.

Create role-specific briefing templates that adapt based on meeting type. For sales meetings, include deal stage, competitor information, and objection handling notes. For product meetings, include user feedback, feature requests, and technical constraints. For executive meetings, include high-level metrics, strategic context, and decision frameworks. These specialized templates ensure briefings contain the most relevant information for each meeting type.

Set up collaborative preparation for team meetings. When multiple people from your team are attending the same meeting, have GAIA create a shared briefing document that everyone can contribute to. Team members can add their own notes, questions, and talking points, creating a comprehensive preparation resource. This collaboration ensures your team arrives aligned and coordinated rather than each person preparing independently.

Integrate with your note-taking system to automatically create meeting notes templates pre-populated with the briefing information. When the meeting starts, you have a structured document ready for capturing discussion, decisions, and action items. After the meeting, GAIA can analyze your notes to extract action items, update task lists, and send follow-up emails automatically.

Add post-meeting analysis that compares your briefing to what actually happened in the meeting. Did the discussion cover the topics you prepared for, or did it go in unexpected directions? Were the decisions you anticipated actually made? This feedback loop helps GAIA improve its briefing relevance over time by learning what information proves most valuable in practice.

The meeting prep workflow represents GAIA's vision of proactive assistance—anticipating your needs before you even think about them and ensuring you're always prepared for success. By automating the research and context gathering that makes meetings productive, it frees you to focus on the human elements of communication, persuasion, and relationship building that AI can't replicate.
