ONBOARDING_LABEL: Final[str] = "onboarding"

# Label that marks a todo as "tracked" — GAIA's institutional-memory layer.
# Kept here (not in tracked_todo_service) so the VFS sync glue can import it
# without creating a circular dependency.
GAIA_TRACKED_LABEL: Final[str] = "gaia-tracked"

# Label added by the worker when a tracked todo exhausts its retry budget — the
# execution path skips todos carrying it until the user manually resets.
FAILED_LABEL: Final[str] = "failed"

# Label added by the maintenance sweep to an overdue todo with no scheduled
# follow-up, so the UI can surface it for attention.
NEEDS_FOLLOW_UP_LABEL: Final[str] = "needs-follow-up"
