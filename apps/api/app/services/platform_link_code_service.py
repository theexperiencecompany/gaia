"""One-tap platform-linking codes, minted by the web during onboarding.

The mirror image of platform_link_token (endpoints/bot.py), which the
BOT mints and the WEB redeems: here the WEB mints a code bound to the user, the
user carries it to the platform (invisibly in a Telegram deep link, visibly as a
trailing #code in the WhatsApp/iMessage message they send), and the BOT
redeems it on first contact. Nobody has to type /auth.

Security properties match connect_link_service (128-bit opaque code, the
binding lives server-side, bounded TTL) except for how the code is spent: a
redemption takes a short-lived claim (claim_platform_link_code) and deletes the
record once the link is written (discard_platform_link_code). A redemption
refused before the link is written releases the claim (release_platform_link_code)
so the retry can use the same code; one that breaks after spends it, because a
retry would run the existing link's side effects a second time.
