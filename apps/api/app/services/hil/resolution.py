"""Apply a HIL decision and resume the executor run it paused.

The single entry point for every decision source — approval buttons, a bot's
interactive component, the conversational resolver, and the timeout sweep. Each
supplies a DecisionKind; everything else is identical.

Two guarantees:

* **Exactly once.** The pending -> decided transition is a conditional Mongo
  update. A double click, a racing bot callback, and a sweep firing against an
  approval the user just answered all lose the race and resolve nothing.
* **The run always continues.** Whatever the decision, the paused thread is
  re-dispatched so it either performs the action or tells the model it was
  refused. A resolved approval that never resumed would strand the conversation's
  executor lock until its TTL.
