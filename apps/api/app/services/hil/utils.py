Everything the gate and the judge need to *look at* — the tool call, the run's identity,
the graph state, the untrusted argument payload — is read through here, so the modules
that make decisions stay about decisions.

The graph-state readers expose tool *calls* (with their outputs, which carry
minted ids) and the assistant's recent *words* as labeled provenance — never as
authorization. The authority line stays where it was: only the user's turns
authorize (see intent.py).
