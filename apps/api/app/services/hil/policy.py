"""What HIL should do about one tool call — before anything is asked, judged, or run.

This module answers two questions and nothing else, so the gate can stay about acting:

1. **Is this tool gated?** is_gated — the user's per-tool override, else the
   destructive classification. This set is identical in both gating modes.
2. **What happens to the gated set?** resolve_policy — ask (confirm with the
   user) or auto (let the intent judge decide). always_allow gates nothing.

Plus one guard that belongs with the policy because it *suppresses* auto-approval:
has_pausing_sibling — see its docstring for the double-execution it prevents.
