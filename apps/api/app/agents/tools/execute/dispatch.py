"""The dispatch core: resolve → validate → invoke, for both execute surfaces.

The LLM-facing ``execute`` tool and the sandbox code-mode route both call
``dispatch_tool`` — there is exactly one place a proxied tool is resolved,
validated and run, so classification, analytics and error shapes cannot drift
between the two surfaces.

Predictable failures (unknown tool, out-of-scope tool, args that fail the
schema, a tool that outruns the execution bound) return a structured error the
model can act on. Other infrastructure failures propagate to the caller's error
handling (the ToolNode's error formatting, the route's 500) — they are not the
model's mistake to correct.
