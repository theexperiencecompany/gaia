"""Skill Discovery Service - Generate available skills text for agent prompts.

Implements the "progressive disclosure" model from the Agent Skills spec:
name/description/location injected into the prompt, full SKILL.md and
referenced files read on-demand via read/bash. Two sources merge into one
"Available Skills:" listing: built-in skills (shipped in the repo, loaded
into process memory, NOT in Mongo) and user/system skills (installed per
user, MongoDB via get_skills_for_agent()). Cached in Redis (12h TTL);
invalidated by @CacheInvalidator decorators in registry.py.
