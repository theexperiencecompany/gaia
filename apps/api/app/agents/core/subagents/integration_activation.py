"""Integration activation — pull an integration into the caller's own context.

activate_integration(integration_id) gives the caller everything the
integration's own subagent used to get at startup, without the second graph: its
tools registered AND the most-used ones bound in this same turn, its operating
prompt, the active account, standing instructions, and its skills. Execution
stays with the caller — no worker graph, no handoff; spawn_subagent inherits the
bound tools when work needs isolating.

Binding in-turn is the point. Returning only prose would leave the caller to
spend a whole retrieve_tools round trip rediscovering tools the config names.
