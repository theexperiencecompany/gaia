"""Stop a repeated cumulative usage frame from being billed once per stream chunk.

Some providers (DEV_LLM's deepseek-v4-flash) repeat the OpenAI-wire cumulative
usage snapshot on nearly every chunk instead of once (openrouter.ai's
behavior) — an 8-chunk answer saw 5 frames of prompt_tokens=89 with completion
counts 1 → 6 → 10 → 10 → 10. AIMessageChunk.__add__ ADDS usage via add_usage,
so the merged message claimed 445/37 tokens for a call that spent 89/10,
corrupting billing, budget checks, and the frontend's usage display.

Fix: convert each snapshot to the delta since the last one before it leaves
the stream — summing deltas lands on the real final snapshot, and
single-frame providers are unaffected. Not fixed in add_usage itself: that
function also totals usage ACROSS calls for UsageMetadataCallbackHandler,
which must keep adding. run_manager stays in the signature but langchain-core
1.4.8 never passes it (verified zero calls across all 4 entry points).
