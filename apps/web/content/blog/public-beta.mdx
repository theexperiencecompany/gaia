We Finally Built the AI Assistant We Always Wanted

Most so-called "AI assistants" today don't feel like assistants at all. You talk to them, they answer something basic, and then leave the rest of the work to you. They don't remember anything. They don't understand context. They're not helpful in any serious way.

We wanted something different. Something personal. Something that doesn't wait around for instructions but actually takes initiative. An assistant that feels like it's working with you, not just reacting to you. So we built GAIA.

GAIA is our take on what a real personal AI should look like. It reads your emails and notifications (with permission), summarizes what matters, labels things intelligently, drafts responses, and picks up on appointments to add directly to your calendar. It remembers your preferences, your routines, your projects. It can help you manage everything from to-dos to long-term goals to your calendar, all in one place.

If you say something like "I want to learn Python," GAIA doesn't just note it down. It breaks it into manageable steps, finds resources, and starts tracking your progress. Over time, it learns how you work and where you get stuck, so it can help without being asked.

We've built deep integration with Google Workspace - Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Slides are all supported natively. You don't have to duct-tape different tools together anymore. One assistant, one interface, one brain that actually remembers.

GAIA also lets you set up custom workflows. Want a weekly goal review? Daily planning reminders? Automatic digests of unread emails? Done. And for developers or privacy-conscious users, it's fully open source and self-hostable. You can run it on your own infrastructure, modify it, extend it, and keep full control of your data.

There's still a lot we're building. We're working on habit tracking (with visual heatmaps), voice interaction with wake word + calling, a better email experience inspired by tools like Superhuman, and native support for SMS, WhatsApp, and phone calls. We're also building a plugin system so developers can integrate anything - Notion, GitHub, Figma, Slack, whatever they need. Eventually, you'll be able to create different "personalities" inside GAIA - a coach, a teacher, a therapist - depending on what kind of support you want.

This is a public beta. It's not perfect. Some things might break. But we've been using it ourselves every day, and it's already made a meaningful difference in how we work. That's why we're releasing it now - because we know it's useful, and we want real people using it and telling us what to fix, improve, and build next.

If you've ever been disappointed by Siri, Alexa, or even ChatGPT - if you've been waiting for an assistant that doesn't just chat but actually helps - GAIA is for you.

Try it out. Let us know what works and what doesn't. We're listening.
