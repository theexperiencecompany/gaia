    - At least 8GB of RAM (16GB recommended)
    - SSD storage for better performance
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Development Environment Setup

To start developing on GAIA, you need to set up your local environment. You can choose between an automated setup using mise or a manual setup.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Automated Setup (Recommended)" icon="rocket">
    We use **mise** to automate the entire setup process. This is the recommended method for all users.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Install mise">
        First, install mise if you haven't already:

        ```bash
        curl https://mise.run | sh
        ```

        Or follow the [mise installation guide](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html) for other methods.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Setup Environment Variables">
        Copy the example environment files and configure them:

        ```bash
        cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
        cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
        ```

        Then configure your environment variables by following the [Environment Variables Reference](/configuration/environment-variables).
      </Step>

      <Step title="Run Setup">
        Run the automated setup from the project root:

        ```bash
        mise setup
        ```

        This will:
        - ✅ Check environment files exist
        - 🐳 Start all Docker services
        - 🐍 Install Python 3.11 and create virtual environment
        - 📦 Install backend dependencies with uv
        - ⚛️ Install Node.js 22 and frontend dependencies with pnpm
        - 🤖 Seed AI models and workflows
      </Step>

      <Step title="Start Development">
        Your development environment is now ready! Start coding:

        ```bash
        mise dev:backend   # Start backend
        mise dev:frontend  # Start frontend
        mise dev:all       # Start both
        ```

        See all available commands: `mise tasks`
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Manual Setup" icon="wrench">
    If you prefer to set up your environment manually or want more control, follow these steps.

### Environment Variables

Before you start the services, you need to configure your environment variables. GAIA uses `.env` files to manage these settings.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Copy Example Files">
    We provide example files to get you started. Copy them to create your own `.env` files:

    ```bash
    cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
    cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Fill in Your Secrets">
    Edit the newly created `.env` files and fill in your API keys and other secrets.

    For a detailed explanation of all the available environment variables, see the [Environment Variables Reference](/configuration/environment-variables).

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Backend Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start Docker Services">
    GAIA relies on several services that run in Docker containers. You have two options:

    **Option 1: Start all services (including frontend in Docker)**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    **Option 2: Start only backend services (recommended for development)**
    ```bash
    docker compose --profile backend-only up -d
    ```

    <Note>
      **Why use backend-only profile?**

      Running the frontend in Docker can introduce slight latency and slower hot reloading. For the best development experience, we recommend using the `backend-only` profile and running the frontend manually with `mise dev` (see Frontend Setup below).
    </Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Virtual Environment">
    Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Backend Dependencies">
    We use `uv` for fast dependency management. Install the required packages:

    ```bash
    mise install
    ```

    Or directly with uv:
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Frontend Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Frontend Directory">
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Frontend Dependencies">
    We use `pnpm` for managing frontend packages. Install them with:

    ```bash
    mise install
    ```

    Or directly with pnpm:
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Development Server (Recommended)">
    For the best development experience with fast hot reloading, run the frontend manually:

    ```bash
    mise dev
    ```

    This will start the Next.js development server on `http://localhost:3000` with optimized hot reloading.

    <Tip>
      **Performance Tip:** Running the frontend outside Docker provides faster hot reloading and better performance during development. The frontend will automatically connect to the backend services running in Docker.
    </Tip>
