## CLI-Based Setup

The GAIA CLI provides the easiest way to set up a self-hosted GAIA instance. It handles repository cloning, tool installation, environment configuration, and service startup through an interactive wizard.

<Info>
For installation instructions, see [CLI Installation](/cli/installation). For the full command reference, see [CLI Commands](/cli/commands).
</Info>

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install the CLI
curl -fsSL https://heygaia.io/install.sh | sh

# Run the setup wizard
gaia init

# Clone a specific branch
gaia init --branch develop
```

## What the Wizard Does

The `gaia init` command walks you through:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prerequisites Check">
    Verifies Git, Docker, and Mise are installed. Installs Mise automatically if missing. Checks for port conflicts and suggests alternatives.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Repository Setup">
    Clones the GAIA repository to your chosen directory with progress tracking.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Tool Installation">
    Installs all required development tools (Node.js, Python, uv, Nx) via Mise.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Environment Configuration">
    Choose between **Self-Host (Docker)** or **Developer Mode (Local)**, then configure environment variables either:
    - **Manually**: Interactive prompts for each variable with descriptions and defaults
    - **Via Infisical**: Enter your Infisical credentials for secret management
  </Step>

  <Step title="Project Setup">
    Runs `mise setup` to install all dependencies, start Docker services, and seed the database.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Service Startup">
    If services aren't already running, optionally starts all services immediately. If they're already running, the wizard detects this and skips to completion.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Already Have the Repo?

If you've already cloned GAIA and just need to configure it, use `gaia setup` instead:

```bash
cd /path/to/gaia
gaia setup
```

This skips cloning and tool installation, going straight to environment configuration and project setup.

## Managing Services After Setup

Once setup is complete, manage your GAIA instance with:

```bash
gaia start    # Start all services
gaia stop     # Stop all services
gaia status   # Check service health
gaia setup    # Reconfigure environment
```

See [CLI Commands](/cli/commands) for full details on each command.

## Environment Variable Auto-Discovery

The CLI automatically discovers environment variables from the codebase at runtime. When a developer adds a new variable to the API settings or web `.env` file, the CLI picks it up automatically — no CLI updates needed.

- **API variables**: Extracted from Python settings files using AST parsing
- **Web variables**: Parsed from `apps/web/.env` at runtime

## Monitoring Logs (Developer Mode)

In developer mode, `gaia start` runs services in the background. Logs are written to `dev-start.log` in the repo root — monitor them with:

```bash
tail -f dev-start.log
```

## Port Conflict Handling

If required ports are already in use, the CLI detects the conflict, shows which process is using the port, and suggests an alternative port. Infrastructure URLs in your `.env` files are automatically updated to use the alternative ports.

Port overrides are saved to `infra/docker/.env` inside your GAIA repo and **persist across `gaia start`/`gaia stop` cycles** — no need to re-run setup. `gaia status` automatically uses the same overridden ports.

To change port assignments after setup, edit `infra/docker/.env` directly:

| Variable | Service | Default |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `API_HOST_PORT` | API | 8000 |
| `WEB_HOST_PORT` | Web | 3000 |
| `POSTGRES_HOST_PORT` | PostgreSQL | 5432 |
| `REDIS_HOST_PORT` | Redis | 6379 |
| `MONGO_HOST_PORT` | MongoDB | 27017 |
| `RABBITMQ_HOST_PORT` | RabbitMQ | 5672 |
| `CHROMA_HOST_PORT` | ChromaDB | 8080 |

<Info>
Restart services after editing: `gaia stop && gaia start`
