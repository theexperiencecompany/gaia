## The problem

Modern knowledge workers juggle dozens of apps, hundreds of notifications, and an endless stream of tasks that demand constant attention. Your calendar, inbox, task manager, and messaging tools don't talk to each other — so you become the glue.

You spend hours every week triaging emails, scheduling meetings, chasing follow-ups, and deciding what to work on next. Not because you're inefficient — but because the tools you use were never designed to think for you.

The result: decision fatigue, context switching, and the feeling that you're always reacting instead of making real progress.

## The solution

GAIA is a proactive personal AI assistant that works across your tools — not inside a single one. It monitors your inbox, calendar, and tasks in the background, surfaces what matters, and takes action before you have to ask.

Instead of waiting for commands, GAIA anticipates what you need:

- Drafts replies to important emails
- Blocks focus time before your calendar fills up
- Creates tasks from conversations and commitments
- Runs multi-step workflows triggered by real events
- Remembers your preferences and adapts over time

GAIA connects to 50+ integrations and operates with a long-term memory of your context — so it gets more useful the longer you use it.

## Open source & self-hostable

GAIA is fully open source, with the ability to self-host on your own infrastructure. That means:

- **Complete data ownership** — your conversations and context stay on your servers
- **Full customization** — modify GAIA to fit your specific workflow
- **No vendor lock-in** — deploy, migrate, or fork whenever you want
- **Community-driven** — built in the open, improved by contributors worldwide

GAIA is licensed under the [Polyform Strict License 1.0.0](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/strict/1.0.0/), which permits noncommercial, personal, and research use.
