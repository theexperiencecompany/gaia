GAIA works across 60+ apps out of the box. Once you connect a tool, GAIA can interact with it directly — drafting emails, creating tasks, scheduling meetings, filing issues — without you having to switch between apps. The more you connect, the more context GAIA has to work with.

## Custom Integrations


If the tool you use isn't in the list, you can build your own integration. GAIA supports custom integrations via API — you define what the integration can do, and GAIA will know when and how to use it.

## Marketplace

The marketplace is where users share integrations and workflows they've built. If someone has already connected a niche tool you use, you can install their integration in a few clicks instead of building it yourself.

You can also publish your own — whether it's a custom integration, a workflow template, or an automation you've set up that others might find useful.

<Card
  title="Browse the Marketplace"
  icon="store"
  href="https://heygaia.io/marketplace"
>
  Find community-built integrations and workflows, or share your own.
</Card>

<Tip>
  Before building a custom integration, check the marketplace first — someone
  may have already built what you need.
