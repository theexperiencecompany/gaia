# GAIA on Telegram

Talk to GAIA, manage todos, and run workflows directly inside Telegram. The bot works in private chats and supports standard Telegram slash commands with autocomplete via BotFather.

## Start Chatting on Telegram

Search for the GAIA bot on Telegram and open a private chat — no group or server needed.

<Tip>
  Telegram DMs are fully private — only you and GAIA see the conversation. You can send free-text messages at any time without using a command prefix.
</Tip>

## Getting Started (Users)

### 1. Start the Bot

Send the `/start` command to begin:

```
/start
```

You'll see a welcome message with an overview of available commands.

### 2. Link Your GAIA Account

```
/auth
```

Click the link provided, log in to your GAIA account, and your Telegram identity will be connected.

### 3. Start Chatting

```
/gaia What's on my todo list?
```

You can also send a free-text message directly — the bot will forward it to GAIA automatically.

### Available Commands

#### Chat

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/start` | Start the bot and see the welcome message |
| `/gaia <message>` | Send a message to GAIA |
| `/help` | Show all available commands |

## Developer Setup

This section is for developers who want to self-host the GAIA Telegram bot.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and pnpm
- A Telegram account
- GAIA API running (see [Self-Hosting Guide](/self-hosting/overview))

### Step 1: Create a Telegram Bot

1. Open Telegram and search for [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
2. Send `/newbot`
3. Follow the prompts to choose a **name** and **username** for your bot
4. Copy the **bot token** BotFather gives you

### Step 2: Register Commands (Optional but Recommended)

Send `/setcommands` to BotFather, select your bot, then paste:

```
start - Start the bot
gaia - Chat with GAIA
auth - Link your Telegram account
todo - Manage todos
workflow - Manage workflows
conversations - View conversations
new - Start a new conversation
stop - Stop current response and start fresh
status - Check bot status
settings - View your GAIA settings
help - Show help message
unlink - Disconnect your account
```

This enables Telegram's command autocomplete for users.

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in `apps/bots/telegram/`:

```bash
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
GAIA_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
GAIA_BOT_API_KEY=your_secure_bot_api_key
```

### Step 4: Start the Bot

```bash
# Development (hot reload)
nx dev bot-telegram

# Production
nx build bot-telegram && nx start bot-telegram
```

The bot uses **long polling** — no webhook or public URL is required.

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| Bot doesn't respond | Check the bot token is correct and the process is running |
| Commands not showing autocomplete | Run `/setcommands` with BotFather |
| Authentication fails | Ensure `GAIA_BOT_API_KEY` matches the API config and the API is reachable |
