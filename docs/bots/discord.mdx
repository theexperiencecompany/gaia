# GAIA on Discord

Chat with your AI assistant, manage todos, and run workflows without leaving Discord. GAIA's Discord bot supports slash commands with autocomplete, DMs, and `@mention` responses in any channel.

## Add GAIA to Your Server

## Getting Started (Users)

Once GAIA is in your server (or you've joined the community server), you can start using it right away.

### 1. Link Your GAIA Account

Before using most commands, link your Discord account to GAIA:

```
/auth
```

You'll receive a link — click it, log in to your GAIA account, and your Discord identity will be connected automatically.

### 2. Start Chatting

Use the slash command in any channel:

```
/gaia What's on my schedule today?
```

Mention GAIA in any channel:

```
@GAIA Summarize my pending todos
```

Or **send GAIA a private message** — open a DM with the bot and type freely, no slash command needed:

```
What's on my calendar this week?
```

<Tip>
  DMs are the most private way to use GAIA on Discord. Your messages are only visible to you and the bot — no server members can see the conversation.
</Tip>

For the full list of available commands, see the [Commands Reference](/bots/commands).

### Notes

- All slash command responses are **ephemeral** (only visible to you) by default
- Responses are streamed — a typing indicator appears while GAIA is thinking
- Long responses are automatically truncated to Discord's 2000 character limit

## Developer Setup

This section is for developers who want to self-host the GAIA Discord bot.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and pnpm
- A [Discord Developer Account](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- GAIA API running (see [Self-Hosting Guide](/self-hosting/overview))

### Step 1: Create a Discord Application

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click **New Application** and give it a name
3. Navigate to the **Bot** section and click **Add Bot**
4. Under **Privileged Gateway Intents**, enable:
   - **Message Content Intent**
   - **Server Members Intent** (optional)
5. Copy the **Bot Token**

### Step 2: Configure OAuth2 Scopes

1. Go to **OAuth2 → URL Generator**
2. Select scopes: `bot` and `applications.commands`
3. Select bot permissions: **Send Messages**, **Use Slash Commands**, **Read Message History**
4. Copy the generated URL and use it to invite the bot to your server

### Step 3: Set Up OAuth for Account Linking

This enables users to link their Discord account from the GAIA web app via OAuth instead of the `/auth` bot command.

1. In your Discord application, go to **OAuth2**
2. Under **Redirects**, add:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/api/v1/platform-auth/discord/callback
   https://your-api-domain.com/api/v1/platform-auth/discord/callback
   ```
3. Copy your **Client ID** (shown at the top of the OAuth2 page)
4. Click **Reset Secret** to generate a **Client Secret** and copy it

Add to `apps/api/.env`:

```bash
DISCORD_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
DISCORD_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
```

<Note>
  The Client ID here is the same as your `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` used by the bot — it's the application ID, not a separate credential.
</Note>

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in `apps/bots/discord/`:

```bash
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_discord_client_id
GAIA_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
GAIA_BOT_API_KEY=your_secure_bot_api_key
```

`GAIA_BOT_API_KEY` must match the value configured in your GAIA API.

### Step 5: Deploy Slash Commands

Register the bot's slash commands with Discord:

```bash
nx run bot-discord:deploy-commands
```

This only needs to be run once (or whenever commands change).

### Step 6: Start the Bot

```bash
# Development (hot reload)
nx dev bot-discord

# Production
nx build bot-discord && nx start bot-discord
```

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| Bot doesn't respond to commands | Run `nx run bot-discord:deploy-commands`, check bot permissions |
| Authentication link doesn't work | Verify `GAIA_BOT_API_KEY` matches API config |
| Bot offline | Check that the process is running and `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` is valid |
