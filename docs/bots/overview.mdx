## What You Can Do

All GAIA bots give you access to the same core capabilities:

- **Chat with GAIA** — Ask questions, get summaries, request actions
- **Manage todos** — Create, view, complete, and delete todos
- **Run workflows** — Execute and monitor your automated workflows
- **View conversations** — Browse your chat history with links to the web interface
- **Link your account** — Securely connect your messaging account to GAIA
- **Stop a response** — Cancel the current response and start fresh with `/stop`
- **Unlink your account** — Disconnect from GAIA directly from the bot with `/unlink`

## Talking to GAIA: Quick Start

### Step 1 — Link your account

Before using most features, connect your messaging account to GAIA:

```
/auth
```

You'll receive a link — click it, log in, and your account is connected.

### Step 2 — Start chatting

```
/gaia What's on my schedule today?
```

On Telegram, you can also send free-text messages directly without a command prefix.
On Discord, you can `@mention` GAIA in any channel.
On Slack, you can DM the bot directly for free-text chat.

### Step 3 — Manage your work

```
/todo list
/workflow list
/conversations
```

See the [Commands Reference](/bots/commands) for the full list.

## For Developers

Want to self-host the bots or add them to your own server/workspace? Each platform has a dedicated setup guide:

- [Discord Setup](/bots/discord#developer-setup)
- [Slack Setup](/bots/slack#developer-setup)
- [Telegram Setup](/bots/telegram#developer-setup)

All bots are open source and part of the GAIA monorepo under `apps/bots/`.
