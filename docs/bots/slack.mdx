# GAIA on Slack

Use GAIA directly inside Slack — chat, manage todos, and run workflows from any channel or DM. The Slack bot runs via Socket Mode so no public URL or port forwarding is required.

## Getting Started (Users)

If the GAIA Slack app has been installed in your workspace, you can start using it immediately.

### 1. Link Your GAIA Account

```
/auth
```

You'll receive a link — click it, log in to your GAIA account, and your Slack identity will be connected.

### 2. Start Chatting

```
/gaia What should I focus on today?
```

You can also `@mention` GAIA in any channel it's been added to.

For the full list of available commands, see the [Commands Reference](/bots/commands).

### Notes

- All responses are **ephemeral** (only visible to you)
- Works in DMs and any channel the bot has been invited to
- Slash commands must be configured in the Slack app dashboard (see developer setup below)

## Developer Setup

This section is for developers who want to self-host the GAIA Slack bot.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and pnpm
- A Slack workspace where you have **admin access**
- GAIA API running (see [Self-Hosting Guide](/self-hosting/overview))

### Step 1: Create a Slack App

1. Go to [api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Click **Create New App → From scratch**
3. Give your app a name and select your workspace

### Step 2: Enable Socket Mode

1. In the sidebar, go to **Socket Mode**
2. Toggle **Enable Socket Mode** on
3. Generate an **App-Level Token** with the `connections:write` scope
4. Copy the token — it starts with `xapp-`

### Step 3: Configure Bot Permissions

1. Go to **OAuth & Permissions**
2. Under **Bot Token Scopes**, add:
   - `chat:write`
   - `commands`
   - `im:history`
   - `im:read`
   - `im:write`
3. Under **User Token Scopes**, add:
   - `identity.basic`
4. Under **Redirect URLs**, add:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/api/v1/platform-auth/slack/callback
   https://your-api-domain.com/api/v1/platform-auth/slack/callback
   ```
5. Click **Install App to Workspace** (or **Reinstall** if already installed)
6. Copy the **Bot User OAuth Token** (starts with `xoxb-`)
7. Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from **Basic Information**
8. Copy the **Signing Secret** from **Basic Information**

### Step 4: Register Slash Commands

Go to **Slash Commands** and create each command listed in the [Commands Reference](/bots/commands). Request URL can be left blank in Socket Mode.

### Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in `apps/bots/slack/`:

```bash
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-your-app-token
SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your-signing-secret
GAIA_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
GAIA_BOT_API_KEY=your_secure_bot_api_key
```

For OAuth account linking, also add to `apps/api/.env`:

```bash
SLACK_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
SLACK_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
```

These enable users to link their Slack account from the GAIA web app settings page.

### Step 6: Start the Bot

```bash
# Development (hot reload)
nx dev bot-slack

# Production
nx build bot-slack && nx start bot-slack
```

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| Bot doesn't respond | Check Socket Mode is enabled and all tokens are correct |
| Command not found | Verify slash commands are created in the Slack app dashboard, then reinstall the app |
| Authentication fails | Ensure `GAIA_BOT_API_KEY` matches the API config |
