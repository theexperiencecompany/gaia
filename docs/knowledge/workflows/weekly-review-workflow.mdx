# Weekly Review Workflow

The weekly review is one of the most powerful productivity habits, yet it's also one of the most commonly skipped. When Friday afternoon arrives and you're mentally exhausted from a full week of work, the last thing you want to do is manually compile what you accomplished, review what fell through the cracks, and plan for next week. GAIA's weekly review workflow automates this entire process, transforming a tedious manual task into an insightful, energizing reflection that takes just minutes to review.

This workflow goes far beyond a simple list of completed tasks. GAIA analyzes your entire week across all connected systems—emails sent and received, meetings attended, tasks completed, goals progressed, and documents created. It identifies patterns in how you spent your time, highlights your biggest accomplishments, surfaces items that need attention, and generates a strategic plan for the coming week. The result is a comprehensive weekly review that would take an hour to compile manually but arrives automatically every Friday afternoon.

## How the Workflow Operates

The weekly review workflow triggers every Friday at 4 PM, giving you time to review it before the weekend while the week is still fresh in your mind. GAIA begins by gathering data from all your connected productivity tools, creating a complete picture of your week. It pulls your calendar to see how many meetings you attended and how much time you spent in calls versus focused work. It analyzes your email to count messages sent and received, identify key conversations, and track response times. It reviews your task manager to see what you completed, what's still in progress, and what's overdue.

The workflow starts with accomplishment tracking, where GAIA identifies everything you completed this week. This goes beyond just checking off tasks—the AI recognizes significant achievements like finishing a major project milestone, shipping a product feature, closing a sales deal, or completing a research report. It pulls from multiple sources to build this picture: a task marked complete in your todo list, a project status updated to "shipped" in Linear, a document marked as final in Google Docs, or an email thread that concluded with a successful outcome. GAIA understands that accomplishments aren't always explicitly tracked, so it uses AI to infer completion from context.

Next comes time analysis, where the workflow examines how you allocated your hours. It calculates that you spent eighteen hours in meetings this week, up from fourteen last week. It notices you had only six hours of uninterrupted focus time, down from ten hours the previous week. The AI identifies patterns like meeting-heavy Tuesdays and Thursdays versus more focused Mondays and Wednesdays. This analysis helps you understand whether your time allocation matches your priorities—if your top goal is deep work on a strategic project but you only had six hours of focus time, that's a misalignment worth addressing.

The workflow then performs goal progress tracking by comparing your weekly activities against your quarterly objectives. If one of your goals is "Launch new product feature," GAIA tracks related tasks completed, design documents created, code commits made, and stakeholder meetings held. It calculates that you made progress on three of your five quarterly goals this week, with two goals receiving no attention. This visibility helps you course-correct before goals fall too far behind.

Email and communication analysis provides insights into your responsiveness and communication patterns. GAIA calculates your average email response time (four hours for high-priority messages, two days for low-priority), identifies important emails you haven't responded to yet, and highlights conversations that need follow-up next week. It also analyzes meeting effectiveness by checking whether meetings had agendas, whether action items were captured, and whether follow-ups occurred. This communication audit helps you identify where you're being responsive and where things are slipping through the cracks.

The workflow concludes with next week planning, where GAIA generates a strategic preview of the coming week. It shows you have twelve meetings scheduled, identifies three deadlines approaching, surfaces tasks that have been pending for multiple weeks, and suggests priorities based on goal alignment. The AI might recommend blocking focus time on Tuesday morning when you have a three-hour gap, or suggest rescheduling a non-urgent meeting to create more space for deep work. This forward-looking planning ensures you start Monday with clarity rather than scrambling to figure out your priorities.

## Setting Up Your Weekly Review Workflow

Creating your weekly review workflow begins with ensuring all your productivity tools are connected to GAIA. The more data sources you connect, the more comprehensive your review becomes. At minimum, connect your calendar and task manager. For a complete picture, also connect your email, project management tools, document systems, and any communication platforms like Slack. These integrations allow GAIA to see your full work picture rather than just fragments.

Navigate to the workflow builder and search for "Weekly Review" in the community templates. GAIA provides a pre-built workflow that you can activate immediately or customize to your preferences. The default trigger is Friday at 4 PM, but you can adjust this based on your schedule. Some users prefer Friday at noon to review before lunch, while others prefer Friday at 6 PM to review as they're wrapping up for the weekend. If you work non-traditional hours or prefer to do your review on Sunday evening, adjust the schedule accordingly.

Customize the accomplishment tracking by defining what counts as a significant achievement in your work. For a software developer, this might include merged pull requests, resolved bugs, and shipped features. For a sales professional, it might include closed deals, qualified leads, and client meetings. For a content creator, it might include published articles, social media posts, and audience growth metrics. Teaching GAIA what matters in your role ensures the accomplishment summary highlights what's truly important rather than just counting completed tasks.

Configure your time analysis preferences by setting thresholds for what you consider healthy time allocation. If you believe you need at least ten hours of focus time per week to do your best work, set that as a target so GAIA alerts you when you fall short. If you want to limit meetings to twenty hours per week, set that boundary so the workflow flags when you're over-scheduled. These thresholds turn the time analysis from descriptive to prescriptive, giving you actionable insights rather than just numbers.

Set up goal tracking by connecting your quarterly objectives to the weekly review. In GAIA's goal system, create your three to five most important goals for the quarter and tag related tasks, projects, and calendar events. The weekly review workflow will automatically track progress on these goals and alert you when goals aren't receiving attention. You can also set minimum weekly progress thresholds—for example, requiring at least three hours of work per week on your top priority goal.

Define your review delivery format based on how you prefer to consume information. GAIA can generate a detailed written report with sections for accomplishments, time analysis, goal progress, and next week planning. Alternatively, it can create a visual dashboard with charts showing time allocation, goal progress bars, and task completion trends. Some users prefer a concise executive summary that fits on one screen, while others want comprehensive details they can review over fifteen minutes. Choose the format that matches your review style.

## Outcomes and Benefits

The weekly review workflow creates a powerful feedback loop that drives continuous improvement in your productivity. By seeing objective data about how you spent your time and what you accomplished, you gain insights that are impossible to perceive in the moment. You might discover that weeks with more than twenty hours of meetings correlate with lower task completion, suggesting you need to protect more focus time. Or you might notice that your most productive weeks have a consistent pattern of morning deep work followed by afternoon meetings, informing how you structure future weeks.

The accomplishment summary provides a psychological boost that combats the feeling of never getting anything done. Knowledge work often feels like pushing water uphill—you're always busy but rarely feel like you're making progress. The weekly review changes this by explicitly cataloging everything you completed. Seeing that you finished twelve tasks, attended eight productive meetings, and made progress on three major projects gives you a sense of achievement that motivates you into the next week. This positive reinforcement is especially valuable during challenging periods when progress feels slow.

The workflow also prevents important items from falling through the cracks. When GAIA surfaces that you haven't responded to an important email from three days ago, or that a task has been pending for two weeks without progress, you can address these gaps before they become problems. This safety net means you can work with confidence, knowing that nothing critical will be forgotten. Colleagues and clients notice your reliability—you become someone who follows through consistently because your system ensures nothing gets lost.

Goal tracking through the weekly review ensures your daily work connects to your long-term objectives. It's easy to spend weeks being busy without making progress on what truly matters. When the weekly review shows that two of your five quarterly goals received zero attention this week, that's a clear signal to reprioritize. Over time, this alignment compounds into meaningful achievement on your most important objectives rather than just staying busy with whatever's urgent.

The next week planning component helps you start Monday with momentum rather than confusion. Instead of spending Monday morning figuring out what to work on, you arrive with a clear plan generated from Friday's review. You know your top three priorities, you've identified time blocks for focused work, and you've prepared for upcoming deadlines. This clarity eliminates the Monday morning scramble and helps you hit the ground running.

The workflow also improves your time management skills through pattern recognition. After several weeks of reviews, you'll notice trends in your productivity. Maybe you're consistently over-scheduled on Thursdays, or perhaps you're most productive on days with no meetings before noon. These insights inform how you structure your calendar going forward. You might start blocking Mondays for deep work, or establish a policy of no meetings after 3 PM on Fridays. The data-driven insights from weekly reviews help you optimize your schedule based on actual patterns rather than assumptions.

## Advanced Customizations

Power users can enhance the weekly review workflow with additional analysis and automation. Add team performance tracking if you're a manager, showing how your direct reports are progressing on their goals and where they might need support. Integrate with your company's project management system to track team-wide milestones and deliverables. Include financial metrics if you're in sales or run a business, showing revenue generated, deals closed, or expenses managed.

Create comparative analysis by having GAIA track your weekly metrics over time. The workflow can show that your focus time has been declining for three consecutive weeks, or that your email response time has improved by 40% since implementing the daily planning workflow. These trends help you understand whether your productivity is improving or declining, and what factors correlate with your best weeks. You might discover that weeks with morning exercise correlate with higher task completion, or that weeks with fewer than fifteen meetings are significantly more productive.

Set up automated actions based on review insights. If the workflow detects you're consistently over-scheduled, have it automatically suggest meetings to decline or reschedule. If goal progress is lagging, have it create priority tasks for next week to get back on track. If email response time is slipping, have it draft responses to pending messages so you can quickly catch up. These automated interventions turn insights into action without requiring manual follow-up.

For teams, create a shared weekly review that aggregates individual reviews into a team summary. This gives managers visibility into team accomplishments, workload distribution, and potential bottlenecks without requiring status meetings. Team members can see what colleagues accomplished, fostering appreciation and collaboration. The shared review can also identify cross-team dependencies and coordination needs for the coming week.

The weekly review workflow embodies GAIA's philosophy of proactive intelligence—not just tracking what you do but helping you understand patterns, celebrate progress, and continuously improve. By automating the tedious work of compiling your week, it makes the powerful habit of weekly reviews sustainable and valuable.
