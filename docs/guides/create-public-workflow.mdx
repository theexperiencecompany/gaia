## Overview

Publish your workflows to the GAIA community marketplace so others can discover and use your automations.

## Create Your Workflow

Navigate to the Workflows page and click **Create Workflow**.

  alt="Workflows page with create button"
/>

Enter a clear title and description that explains what your workflow does.

<img
  className="rounded-lg"
  src="/images/guides/workflows/create.webp"
  alt="Create workflow form"
/>

<Tip>
  Use descriptive titles like "Daily Sales Report Generator" instead of just
  "Report Generator"
</Tip>

## Publish to Community

Once your workflow is created and tested, open it from your workflows list. Click the three-dot menu (⋮) in the top-right corner and select **Publish Workflow**.

  alt="Publish workflow option"
/>

Your workflow is now live in the community marketplace!

## View on Marketplace

After publishing, you can view your workflow on the marketplace by selecting **View on Marketplace** from the same menu.

<img
  className="rounded-lg"
  src="/images/guides/workflows/view_marketplace.webp"
  alt="View workflow on marketplace"
/>

<Warning>
  Test your workflow thoroughly before publishing to ensure it works reliably
  for other users
</Warning>

## Community Guidelines

Published workflows must:

- Solve a real problem or automate a useful task
- Have accurate titles and descriptions
- Work reliably as described
- Respect user privacy and data

<Note>
  Workflows that violate community guidelines may be removed from the
  marketplace
</Note>
