Copy-ready outreach email templates for each link building strategy. Includes subject line variations, follow-up sequences, personalization tips, and response handling scripts.

## General Outreach Principles

Before using any template, follow these rules:

| Principle | Why It Matters |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Personalize every email** | Generic emails get deleted. Reference specific content. |
| **Lead with value** | Explain what is in it for them before making your ask. |
| **Keep it short** | 100-150 words maximum for initial outreach. |
| **One clear ask** | Do not combine multiple requests in one email. |
| **Professional sender address** | Use name@yourdomain.com, not a free email provider. |
| **No attachments on first email** | Attachments trigger spam filters and reduce trust. |
| **Follow up (once or twice)** | Most responses come from follow-ups, not initial emails. |
| **Track everything** | Log outreach in a spreadsheet or CRM for accountability. |

## 12. Subject Line Variations by Strategy

### High-Performing Subject Line Patterns

| Strategy | Subject Lines (pick one) |
|----------|------------------------|
| **Broken link** | "Found a broken link on your [topic] page" / "Quick heads-up about [page title]" / "Broken resource on [their site]" |
| **Guest post** | "Guest post idea: [title]" / "[Topic] contributor for [their site]" / "Content pitch for [their site]" |
| **Resource page** | "Resource for your [topic] page" / "Suggestion for your [topic] list" / "Addition for [page title]?" |
| **Unlinked mention** | "Thanks for mentioning [brand]" / "Re: your mention of [brand/data]" / "Quick favor re: [their article]" |
| **Digital PR** | "New data: [headline stat]" / "Exclusive: [finding]" / "[Topic] research for your coverage" |
| **Skyscraper** | "Updated resource on [topic]" / "Better version of [competitor content]" / "Thought you'd want to see this" |

### Subject Lines to Avoid

| Avoid | Why |
|-------|-----|
| "Link exchange opportunity" | Screams spam and violates Google guidelines |
| "SEO partnership" | Immediately signals manipulative intent |
| ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation | Triggers spam filters, looks unprofessional |
| "I'd love a backlink" | Too direct; leads with your need, not their value |
| Misleading subjects ("Re:" when no prior conversation) | Damages trust immediately |
| Long subjects (>60 characters) | Gets truncated in inbox, lower open rates |
